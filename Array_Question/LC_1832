1832. Check if the Sentence Is Pangram
A pangram is a sentence where every letter of the English alphabet appears at least once.
Given a string sentence containing only lowercase English letters, return true if sentence is a pangram, or false otherwise.

Example 1:
Input: sentence = "thequickbrownfoxjumpsoverthelazydog"
Output: true
Explanation: sentence contains at least one of every letter of the English alphabet.
Example 2:

Input: sentence = "leetcode"
Output: false

Constraints:
1 <= sentence.length <= 1000
sentence consists of lowercase English letters.

Approach:-
   1.Check for length of the geven string is less than or greater than 26. If less than 26 then return false else continue to step 2.
   2.Create an frequency array of size 26 and keep the count in character index countArr[ch-'a']++;
   3.Then check for the countArr elements whether it contains count 0  or less than 1 then return false else return true (if all the index is filled with one character 
     count then all the character has been used in the sentence)

Solution:-
class Solution {
    public boolean checkIfPangram(String sentence) {
     int length=sentence.length();

     if(length<26){
        return false;
     }

     int [] countArr=new int [26];
     for(char c:sentence.toCharArray()){
        countArr[c- 'a']++;
     }

     for(int i:countArr){
        if(i<1 || i==0){
            return false;
        }
     }
     return true;
    }
}
