IMP: Find ceiling of a number 
Ceil in a Sorted Array
Given a sorted array arr[] and an integer x, find the index (0-based) of the smallest element in arr[] that is greater than or equal to x. This element is called the ceil of x. 
If such an element does not exist, return -1.

Note: In case of multiple occurrences of ceil of x, return the index of the first occurrence.

Examples
Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 8, 10, 11, 12, 19], x = 5
Output: 2
Explanation: Smallest number greater than 5 is 8, whose index is 2.

Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 8, 10, 11, 12, 19], x = 20
Output: -1
Explanation: No element greater than 20 is found. So output is -1.

Input: arr[] = [1, 1, 2, 8, 10, 11, 12, 19], x = 0
Output: 0
Explanation: Smallest number greater than 0 is 1, whose indices are 0 and 1. The index of the first occurrence is 0.
Constraints:
1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 106
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 106
0 ≤ x ≤ arr[n-1]

Solution:-
class Solution {
    public int findCeil(int[] arr, int x) {
        // Edge case for handling if arr is null or empty
        if(arr== null || arr.length==0){
            return -1;
        }
        int start=0;
        int end=arr.length-1;
        int result= -1;
        // Edge case if target element is greater than last element of the array
        if(x>arr[end]){
            return -1;
        }
        
        while(start <=end){
            int mid=start+(end-start)/2;
            
            // if(arr[mid]==x){
            //     return mid;
            // }else 
          //if you want to handle the duplicate number as well like [1,2,3,3,3,3,7] then no need to check for mid element.
            if(arr[mid]>=x){
                result=mid;
                end=mid-1;
            }else{
                start=mid+1;
            }
        }
       return result;
    }
}
