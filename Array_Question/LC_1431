1431. Kids With the Greatest Number of Candies
There are n kids with candies. You are given an integer array candies, where each candies[i] represents the number of candies the ith kid has, and an integer extraCandies, denoting the number of extra candies that you have.

Return a boolean array result of length n, where result[i] is true if, after giving the ith kid all the extraCandies, they will have the greatest number of candies among all the kids, or false otherwise.

Note that multiple kids can have the greatest number of candies.

Example 1:
Input: candies = [2,3,5,1,3], extraCandies = 3
Output: [true,true,true,false,true] 
Explanation: If you give all extraCandies to:
- Kid 1, they will have 2 + 3 = 5 candies, which is the greatest among the kids.
- Kid 2, they will have 3 + 3 = 6 candies, which is the greatest among the kids.
- Kid 3, they will have 5 + 3 = 8 candies, which is the greatest among the kids.
- Kid 4, they will have 1 + 3 = 4 candies, which is not the greatest among the kids.
- Kid 5, they will have 3 + 3 = 6 candies, which is the greatest among the kids.

Example 2:
Input: candies = [4,2,1,1,2], extraCandies = 1
Output: [true,false,false,false,false] 
Explanation: There is only 1 extra candy.
Kid 1 will always have the greatest number of candies, even if a different kid is given the extra candy.

Example 3:
Input: candies = [12,1,12], extraCandies = 10
Output: [true,false,true]
 
Constraints:
n == candies.length
2 <= n <= 100
1 <= candies[i] <= 100
1 <= extraCandies <= 50

Approach:-
      1.First find the lergest number of candies among the kids.
      2.Then compare that maximum with kid's candies + extra candies whether it is greater or lesser.

Solution:-
class Solution {
    public static int max(int arr[]){  //For finding the maximum in an array
        int maxm=Integer.MIN_VALUE;

        for(int i=0;i<arr.length;i++){
            if(arr[i]>maxm){
                maxm=arr[i];
            }
        }
        return maxm;
    }
    public List<Boolean> kidsWithCandies(int[] candies, int extraCandies) {
        ArrayList<Boolean> list=new ArrayList<>();
        int maxC=max(candies);

         for(int i=0;i<candies.length;i++){
            if((candies[i]+extraCandies) >= maxC){
                list.add(true);
            }else{
                list.add(false);
            }
         }
         return list;
    }
}
