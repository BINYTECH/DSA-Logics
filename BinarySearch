//Binary Search Algorithm in sorted array
Below is the step-by-step algorithm for Binary Search:

STEP 1: Divide the search space into two halves by finding the middle index "mid". 
STEP 2:Compare the middle element of the search space with the key. 
STEP 3:If the key is found at middle element, the process is terminated.
STEP 4:If the key is not found at middle element, choose which half will be used as the next search space.
-> If the key is smaller than the middle element, then the left side is used for next search.
-> If the key is larger than the middle element, then the right side is used for next search.
STEP 5:This process is continued until the key is found or the total search space is exhausted.



Approach 1:- Iterative Binary Search
public class Main {
    public static void main(String args[]){
      int nums[] = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9};
      int target=8;
      System.out.println(BinarySearch(nums,target));
    }
    public static int BinarySearch(int[] arr, int t) {
      int start=0;
      int end=arr.length-1;
      
      while(start<=end){
        int mid=start+(end-start)/2;
        
        if(t<arr[mid]){
          end=mid-1;
        }else if(t>arr[mid]){
          start=mid+1;
        }else{
          return mid;
        }
      }
      return -1;
    }
}


//Checking for Array is Sorted in Ascending or Descending order

public class Main {
    public static void main(String args[]){
      int nums[] = {9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1};
      int target=6;
      System.out.println(AgnosticBinarySearch(nums,target));
    }
     public static int AgnosticBinarySearch(int[] arr, int t) {
      int start=0;
      int end=arr.length-1;
      boolean isAsc= arr[start]<arr[end]; // To check whether the array is sorted in ascending or descending by comparing the first and last element.
      System.out.println(isAsc);
      
      while(start<=end){
        int mid=start+(end-start)/2;
        
        if(arr[mid]==t){
          return mid;
        }
        
        if(isAsc){
            if(t>arr[mid]){  //Making changes for Ascending array
               end=mid-1;
             }else {
               start=mid+1;
              }
        }
        else{
               if(t>arr[mid]){ //Making changes for descending array
                end=mid-1;
                }else {
                start=mid+1;
            }
        }
      
    }
    return -1;
}
}
